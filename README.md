Using financial data to predict if a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not. It is a binary classification problem i.e a transaction belongs to the positive class (1) if it is a fraud, otherwise it belongs to the negative class (0).

Note: Most feature names have been given anonymous V1, V2,... V28 designations due to confidentiality concerns. These characteristics' values are numerical and the outcome of a PCA transformation. Target variable 'Class' has two possible values: 1 in cases of fraud and 0 in all other cases.
